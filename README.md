# Agile Project for 1DL251

## Knowlage transfer event

What to do for knowledge transfer event?

On seminar we have been thinking of using socrative page, which is a site where we can have multiple choice questions and let the audience answer with their phones. We can then go through each question and have a discussion about all the answers. This is interactive way of knowledge transfer.

Another iteractive knowledge transer is to have like a case which the audience can apply the different methods and try to solve the case.  

## Assessment

All students will recieve a paper with some statements about agile methods and what we talked about, they will then choose if the statement is true or false. This is one part of the individual assessment. Secondly, students will be randomly assigned into groups and we will run a quiz about agile methodology where the winner will have a small price. Teams will hand in their answers and get a second assessment as a group that reflects on their individual score.
