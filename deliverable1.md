# A written pitch of learning outcomes
Teaching objectives for our knowledge transfer event. All student should be able to answer the 4 following questions, with something similar to the corresponding answers:

## What is agile?
Agile development methods are a reaction plan based methods that people used before them. It is a set of values, not a methodology. There are a lot of things that are marketed as agile although they actually are quite far removed from the original movement. We also want students to be able to differentiate Scrum and Kanban methods by their features.  

## How does agile work?
As agile is a set of values, it does not give much in terms of concrete help. Commonly people use Scrum and Kanban as more concrete methods for getting stuff done. Also the basics of how Scrum and Kanban works.

## When does agile work?
Agile works best under some circumstances:
 * Small teams
 * Teams that can meet regularly
 * Projects that allow for some wiggle room in terms of specification
 * Projects where documentation is not a high priority
    
## When doesn't agile work?
When some of the conditions above are not meet, or the company hierarchy/structure makes it hard to actually work in an agile works.
